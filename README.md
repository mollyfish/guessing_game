This is a guessing game to guess how many states I (Molly) have visited.  The game prompts the user for an initial guess.  If the guess is more than five away from the correct answer (too high or too low) the response asks for a new guess and includes language that implies the user was way off and tells them if they were too high or too low.  If the user is within five of the correct answer, the response prompts them for another guess and includes language that tells them they were close and if they were too high or too low.  When they get the correct answer, they get a congratulatory message and the game ends.
